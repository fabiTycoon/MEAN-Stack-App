  <h5>What will my dog do while staying at Holliston Meadows?</h5>
  <p>We offer a variety of activities for your dog, individually tailored to his or her needs. Every dog that stays with us is fed twice a day and always has fresh, filtered water. All dogs are taken out 5 times a day individually. The first time they're let out is around 6am and the last time is usually after 7pm. Every cage is cleaned daily, with fresh bedding.</p>
